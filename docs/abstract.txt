PetName Genie is a single-page web application designed to help pet owners find unique, culturally rich, and emotion-centric names for their pets. Unlike random generators, this tool uses a rule-based logic engine to generate names that align with specific emotional bonds (e.g., Loving, Protective, Proud) and cultural origins (Global, Indian, Western).

The system operates offline using local JSON datasets and requires no backend server. It features a modern, responsive UI built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, ensuring high performance and accessibility (including dark mode and high contrast support). Key features include name meaning explanations in multiple languages (English, Telugu, Hindi) and session-based history tracking.
